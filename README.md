## 🖼️ Description  

Ramsey’s Photography Website is a personal portfolio that captures my creative journey behind the lens. From vibrant cityscapes like Uhuru Park to emotionally charged portraits with friends, this site showcases the world as I see it — raw, real, and full of story. Designed with simplicity and soul, it's more than just a gallery — it's a visual experience for anyone who connects with photography, art, and storytelling.
